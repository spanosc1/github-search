# GitHub User Search

A simple user search application developed for ResultStack's coding challenge.

A user can type a real name or email address of a user they are looking for and receive a list of users matching that criteria.

The app will search automatically when the user stops typing for 1 second, when pressing Enter, or when clicking the Search button.

The results are paginated by 20 results per page and will fetch the next page when the user scrolls near the bottom.

Clicking a search result will display a modal with more of the users information, including links to parts of their GitHub profile and a blog, portfolio, or website if they have included one.
